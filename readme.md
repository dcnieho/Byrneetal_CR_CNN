This repository contains the simulation and model training code, the trained model and the code for evaluating the model on simulated and real images used and developed for the article [Byrne, S.A., Nyström, M., Maquiling, V., Kasneci, E., & Niehorster, D.C. (2023). Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data. _Behavior Research Methods_. doi: 10.3758/s13428-023-02297-w](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02297-w)
